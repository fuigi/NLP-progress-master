Semantic parsing is the task of translating natural language into a formal meaning
representation on which a machine can act. Representations may be an executable language
such as SQL or more abstract representations such as [Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Meaning_Representation).

## AMR parsing

Each AMR is a single rooted, directed graph. AMRs include PropBank semantic roles, within-sentence coreference, named entities and types, modality, negation, questions, quantities, and so on. [See](https://amr.isi.edu/index.html).
In the following tables, systems marked with &hearts; are pipeline systems that require POS as input,
&spades; is for those require NER,
&diams; is for those require syntax parsing,
and &clubs; is for those require SRL.

### Spider

Spider is a large-scale complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL 
dataset. It consists of 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries on 
200 databases with multiple tables covering 138 different domains. In Spider 1.0, 
different complex SQL queries and databases appear in train and test sets. 

The Spider dataset can be accessed and leaderboard can be accessed [here](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider).

### WikiSQL
